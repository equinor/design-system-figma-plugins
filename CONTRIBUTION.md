## Contributions

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! File bug reports and feature requests in Github issues, and [get in touch](#get-in-touch) with us if you want to help us out with implementing the components or have ideas for components we should include in the EDS.

## Get in touch

We use [#eds-design-system][slack] on Slack as our main communication channel – but we have an [internal team][teams] on Teams as well that you can join if you want to get in touch with us. If you’re outside Equinor and want to get in touch with the team, then please create an issue.
